# Vegetable Color and Nutrient Segmentation Project

This project aims to segment vegetables in images based on their color. The color segmentation can then potentially be used as a basis for inferring nutrient information, as different colors in vegetables often correlate with the presence of specific vitamins and phytochemicals.

## Method: Color Segmentation

The primary method used in this project is implemented in the `Vegetable_color_segmentation.py` script. This script likely processes input images to identify and isolate regions of distinct colors that correspond to different parts of the vegetables or different types of vegetables in a scene.

Common techniques for color segmentation might include:
- Converting the image to a suitable color space (e.g., HSV, L*a*b*) that makes color differentiation easier.
- Applying clustering algorithms (like K-Means) to group pixels by color.
- Using color thresholding to select pixels within specific color ranges.
- Morphological operations to clean up the segmented regions.

The output of the script is a segmented image where different colors highlight different areas of interest.

## Input and Output Examples

The following table showcases the original input images and their corresponding segmented outputs generated by the `Vegetable_color_segmentation.py` script.

| Input Image  | Description              | Output Image (Segmented) | Method Used                     |
| :----------- | :----------------------- | :----------------------- | :------------------------------ |
| `veg1.jpg`   | Original image of veg 1  | `Results/veg1.jpg`       | Color Segmentation              |
| `veg2.png`   | Original image of veg 2  | `Results/veg2.jpg`       | Color Segmentation              |
| `veg3.jpg`   | Original image of veg 3  | `Results/veg3.jpg`       | Color Segmentation              |

**Note:**
- Input images are located in the root of the `Vegetable_color_and_nutrients_segmentation` directory.
- Output (segmented) images are stored in the `Results/` subdirectory.
- All paths are relative to the `Vegetable_color_and_nutrients_segmentation` directory.
