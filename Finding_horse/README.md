# Finding Horses in Images Project

This project focuses on implementing and showcasing different methods for detecting horses within images. Horse detection is a specific case of object detection, a common task in computer vision.

## Implemented Methods

The project includes the following methods for horse detection:

### Method 1 (`finding_horse_method1.py`)
This script implements a technique for identifying horses in the input image. The specifics of the algorithm would be detailed in the script itself.
- **Output Example:** `Results/Horse.png` (shows the result of applying this method to `horses.jpg`)

### Method 2 (`finding_horse_method2.py`)
This script implements an alternative technique for horse detection. The approach may differ from Method 1 in terms of algorithms used, pre-processing steps, or feature extraction. The specifics of the algorithm would be detailed in the script itself.
- **Output Example:** An output image specifically for this method is not directly available in the `Results` directory. The script would need to be run to generate its specific output.

## Input and Output Showcase

The primary input image used for demonstration is `horses.jpg`.

| Input Image    | Description              | Output Image(s)                        | Method Used      |
| :------------- | :----------------------- | :------------------------------------- | :--------------- |
| `horses.jpg`   | Original image with horses | `Results/Horse.png`                    | Method 1         |
|                |                          | (Output for Method 2 not pre-generated)| Method 2 (N/A)   |

**Note:**
- The input image is `horses.jpg`.
- Output images generated by the scripts are stored in the `Results/` subdirectory.
- All paths are relative to the `Finding_horse` directory.
